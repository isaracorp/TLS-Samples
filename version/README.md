# ISARA Catalyst™ TLS Testbed Version Sample

## Getting Started

We have created a sample application that demonstrates how to use the
Catalyst TLS version information.

Build the sample application:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DISARA_TLS_ROOT=/path/to/isara_tls_root/ ..
$ make
```

Execute the sample, `version`. It has no parameters.

* See `itls_version.h` in the Catalyst TLS `include` directory.
